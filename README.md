# OSSCameroon brand identity guides

Hello! in this readme you will find some guidelines to help you use our brand identity assets, including our logo, content and trademarks without having to negotiate legal agreements for each use. (It's simple, just follow the rules and we are good)

To make any use of our marks in a way not covered by these guidelines, please feel free to contact us at osscameroon@gmail.com and include a screenshot or detail explanation of intended use.

## OSSCameroon Logo

The OSSCameroon marks include the OSSCameroon name and symbol, and any word(eg tagline), phrase, image, or other designation that identifies the source or origin of any assets from OSSCameroon. Please don't modify the marks or use them in a confusing way, including suggesting sponsorship or endorsement by OSSCameroon, or in a way that may confuse OSSCameroon with another brand (including your own). If you are unsure, please feel free to contact us at osscameroon@gmail.com. Feel free to also check our [brand guide document](./oss_branding/oss_branding_guide.pdf) to know more about our identity.

You can download the branding assets by cloning this repository and then access them from the `oss_branding` [folder](https://github.com/osscameroon/Branding/tree/main/oss_branding).
